    <h2>Skyline Chili</h2>
    <p>Skyline Chili is known for its unique, thin, and savory chili, which stands apart from most other chili varieties due to its distinct spice blend. Key ingredients often include ground beef that's boiled and broken into very fine pieces, tomato paste, and a prominent mix of Mediterranean spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and cumin, along with chili powder, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar. While often debated, some recipes and traditions also include a small amount of unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder to add depth to the flavor.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Mediterranean spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cumin)</li>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
  <li><strong>Combine ingredients:</strong> In a large pot, combine the ground beef (uncooked), water, tomato paste, and all the spices (chili powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cumin, garlic powder/minced garlic), Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar. If using, add the unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder.</li>
  <li><strong>Bring to a boil:</strong> Stir well to break up the beef and mix all ingredients. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduce heat and simmer:</strong> Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. The goal is to maintain a very gentle simmer.</li>
  <li><strong>Simmer for an extended period:</strong> Allow the chili to simmer, uncovered, for at least 2-3 hours, or even longer (up to 4-6 hours is common for richer flavor). The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will meld and the beef will break down into fine particles.</li>
  <li><strong>Stir occasionally:</strong> Stir the chili every 15-30 minutes to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking. Break up any remaining large pieces of beef with a spoon or potato masher.</li>
  <li><strong>Skim fat (optional):</strong> As it simmers, fat will rise to the surface. You can skim off any excess fat with a spoon or ladle, especially before serving.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust seasoning:</strong> Taste the chili and adjust seasonings as needed. You might want to add more salt, chili powder, or other spices to your preference.</li>
  <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the chili hot, typically over spaghetti with a generous amount of shredded cheddar cheese, or as part of other Cincinnati-style chili dishes.</li>
